# Coffee Production Analysis

## Overview
This project contains an analysis of coffee production data focusing on different coffee types and their production volumes over the years from 1990 to 2020. The goal was to identify trends and relationships in the production volumes of various coffee types.

## Files
- [coffee_database.csv](https://github.com/NahomAlemu/Coffee-production-analysis/files/14352198/coffee_database.csv)
- `Coffee_Production.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the data analysis, including data cleaning, aggregation, and correlation analysis.
- `Coffee Production Correlation Analysis Report.pdf`: A detailed report addressing specific questions about the strongest and weakest correlations in coffee production volumes and discussing potential implications.

## Data Aggregation
The analysis includes data aggregation by coffee type for each year, summarizing the total production volumes. The aggregated data is transposed to align with the desired format for comparison purposes.

## Correlation Analysis
A correlation matrix was computed to find the strength of the relationships between different coffee types. The analysis includes:
- Identification of the two coffee types with the strongest correlation.
- Examination of the two coffee types with the weakest correlation.
- Interpretation of the possible reasons behind these relationships.

## Conclusions
The findings have been documented in the `Coffee Production Correlation Analysis Report.pdf` file, which discusses the implications of the production dynamics and external factors influencing coffee production.

## How to Run
To view the analysis, open the `Coffee_Production.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab. Ensure that you have the required dependencies installed, which are listed below.
